**This project's goal was to develop a Deep Q-learning AI to solve a maze problem. The agent, a pirate, is to navigate a pre-made map in order to find the goal, the treasure, located at the end of the map. In this project, I was provided with the code for the treasure map, including its operations of movement, the reward/penalty system, and values of each reward/penalty. I was also provided with the Game Experience, the experience the AI was to learn from based off of the information stored from different trials of navigating the map. Finally, I was given the code for the map matrix, the functoin to create a visual representation of the maze object, the movement functions, the code for how each action returns a reward/penalty, the function to playing a full game, the function to determine whether the pirate can win the game, the code for builind the neural network model, and the code for each score of each game. I was given the task of completing the Q-Training Algorithm for the AI.**

**What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?**
Computer scientists solve complex organizational problems using techincal solutions. It is important because computer and techonology have been integrated into our daily lives. 

**How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?**
As a computer scientist, my approach to a problem is breaking down a problem into its parts to better understand the problem as a whole. Then I would design a solution that addresses each part and implement the solution. As I work, I need to check my solution does not conflict with previously solved problems or creates new problems as it becomes more advanced.

**What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?**
My ethicical responsibilites to the end user and the organization is to maintain transparency in my work so all parties know how their information is being used and where it is going.
